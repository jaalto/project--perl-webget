--text follows this line--

    Hi,

    I'm pleased to announce utility `pwget', which can fetch URLs
    around the globe.

        pwget - Perl webget Project
        http://freecode.net/projects/perlwebget

    Now, what does that has to do with Emacs Lisp? The utility
    includes a configuration files that contain few records of URLs of
    Emacs Lisp developers.

    If you're an Emacs Lisp developer and you're not yet in the
    configuration file yet, please spend a moment and send email
    including the URL of your web page where the code can be found.

    Jari
