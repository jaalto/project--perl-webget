README: Pwget - A Perl derivation of wget
-----------------------------------------

Pwget is similar to wget[1] but it can use categorized configuration
files, analyze Web pages, and "search" for download links as
instructed. Instead of absolute links, it contains heuristics to track
newer versions of files.

The source package directories:

    bin/            The program and system manual page (*.1)
    doc/            Documentation

Important files

    COPYING         GPL v2 or later Licence
    INSTALL         Install instructions
    bin/ChangeLog   Project change records
